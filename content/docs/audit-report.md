# Audit Report

### Coinspect (April 2021\)

In April 2021, UnFederalReserve: Merchant Banking DeFI engaged to us \[Coinspect\] to perform a source code review of their borrowing and lending platform. The objective of the audit was to evaluate the security of their smart contracts.

We focused on flaws that would allow an attacker to:

* Manipulate asset prices returned by the price oracles.
* Subvert the imposed caps on borrowing or supplying.
* Bypass access controls to modify contract state.
