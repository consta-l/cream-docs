# Collateral Factor & Reserve Factor

The reserve factor is the percentage of Fee paid to unFederalReserve. Reserver factor is currently 0% for all coins we have, meaning that no interest paid on the asset goes to unFederalReserve.

In the other hand, the collateral factor is the maximum you can borrow on a particular asset.

Example: The collateral factor for ETH is 75%, if the price of ETH is considered as $1000, the max you will be able to borrow in other assets is worth $750
